# NEW-YEAR-
# New Year Countdown & Portfolio

This project combines a New Year countdown timer and a personal portfolio in a responsive and creative layout. The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and the project is structured for easy understanding and scalability.

## Features

### Countdown Timer

- Includes a "Preview" button to manually show a "Happy New Year" message.
- Automatically displays "Happy New Year" when the countdown reaches zero.

### Personal Portfolio
- Showcases your name, skills, and achievements.
- Includes a profile picture section.
- A clean and responsive layout for both desktop and mobile screens.

## How It Works

   - The timer updates in real time.
